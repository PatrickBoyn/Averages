#Average Weight Program
This is a simmple average weight program that tracks your weight entered, it also will list all the weights entered into the database, there is no DB file here at this point, but I will add it as soon as I get around to finding where it is located. There is also a difference function that subtracts the highest and lowest weights from one another. It will eventually also calculate the two most recent weights from one another, but I don't know how to do that yet.
